//
// this ESLINT config file augments the existing **leading config** in package.json 
// for the sole purpose of making `npm run fix` pass at all times, due to `eslint`
// **not** barfing a hairball because there's an odd bit of code still lingering in 
// there while we specifically want eslint to 'fix' everything in the code that's
// possible to fix!
//
// Hence this config only serves to force any eslint to become **warnings** instead.
